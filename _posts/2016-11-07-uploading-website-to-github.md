We will upload this files to Github to freely host in there. GitHub gives chance to host all kind of public files under a page such as [mehmetakifakkus.github.io](http://mehmetakifakkus.github.io), means **username.github.io**. 

This is called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is a free service by GitHub. GitHub has Jekyll system in it and serves your files with this manner. What we will do is a simple process:

- create a GitHub project with the name: username.github.io
- upload your modified local jekyll files to this project.
- done!
